4. User Journey
4.1 Overview
The Notes Synthesizer is designed around a simple post-meeting workflow: a user finishes a meeting, brings their notes or transcript into the application, and receives a structured, actionable synthesis that they can review, edit, and reuse. The journey prioritizes clarity, trust, and user control, ensuring the system feels assistive rather than authoritative.

4.2 End-to-End User Flow
Step 1: Preparing Meeting Notes
 After completing a meeting, the user has a transcript or set of notes generated by their preferred method (manual notes, transcription tools, or shared documents). These notes may be messy, incomplete, or written in shorthand, reflecting how people naturally capture information during meetings.
Step 2: Inputting Notes into the Application
 The user opens the Notes Synthesizer and is presented with a simple input interface. They can either paste their meeting notes directly into a text area or upload a plain text file. Clear instructions and example placeholders reduce friction and help users understand what kind of input works best.
Step 3: Initiating Synthesis
 Once notes are provided, the user clicks a single primary action button labeled “Synthesize.” This explicit action reinforces the idea that the system operates on user intent rather than automatically processing data without consent.
Step 4: Processing and Feedback
 While the system processes the notes, the user sees a loading state that communicates progress (e.g., reading notes, identifying action items, structuring results). This feedback reassures the user that the system is actively working and reinforces transparency in how the synthesis is produced.
Step 5: Reviewing Synthesized Results
 After processing completes, the user is shown a structured breakdown of the meeting. This includes:
A brief high-level summary of the meeting


A list of action items with inferred owners and deadlines


Documented decisions made during the meeting


Open questions or blockers that require follow-up


Each section is visually separated to reduce cognitive load and allow users to quickly scan for the information most relevant to them.
Step 6: Editing and Validation by the User
 Users can review and edit individual items, correcting details such as ownership, deadlines, or wording. This step reinforces user agency and positions the AI output as a draft rather than a final authority. Where applicable, users can view the source text from the original notes to understand why an item was extracted.
Step 7: Taking Next Actions
 Once satisfied, the user can choose how to proceed. Options include exporting the synthesized notes in a structured format (such as JSON, CSV, or Markdown), saving the results to a document, or generating a new synthesis using revised notes. These actions support a variety of workflows without locking users into a single outcome.

4.3 Key Experience Principles
The user journey is guided by several core principles:
Simplicity: The user is never asked to make complex decisions before seeing value from the system.


Transparency: The system communicates what it is doing and why certain outputs were generated.


Control: Users can edit, reject, or regenerate results at any point.


Trust: Structured outputs are paired with traceability to the original text, increasing confidence in the system’s suggestions.



4.4 Success Criteria for the User Journey
The user journey is considered successful if users can move from raw meeting notes to a clear, actionable synthesis in a single flow, without needing to manually rewrite content or interpret ambiguous summaries. The experience should feel efficient, predictable, and supportive of real-world post-meeting tasks.
