## User Journey

### Overview

The **Notes Synthesizer** is designed around a simple post-meeting workflow: a user finishes a meeting, brings their notes or transcript into the application, and receives a structured, actionable synthesis that they can review, edit, and reuse.

The journey prioritizes **clarity**, **trust**, and **user control**, ensuring the system feels *assistive rather than authoritative*.

---

### End-to-End User Flow

#### Step 1: Preparing Meeting Notes
After completing a meeting, the user has a transcript or set of notes generated by their preferred method (e.g., manual notes, transcription tools, or shared documents). These notes may be messy, incomplete, or written in shorthand, reflecting how people naturally capture information during meetings.

---

#### Step 2: Inputting Notes into the Application
The user opens the Notes Synthesizer and is presented with a simple input interface. They can either:
- Paste meeting notes directly into a text area, or
- Upload a plain text file

Clear instructions and example placeholders reduce friction and help users understand what kind of input works best.

---

#### Step 3: Initiating Synthesis
Once notes are provided, the user clicks a single primary action button labeled **“Synthesize.”**

This explicit action reinforces that the system operates on **user intent**, rather than automatically processing data without consent.

---

#### Step 4: Processing and Feedback
While the system processes the notes, the user sees a loading state that communicates progress, such as:
- Reading notes
- Identifying action items
- Structuring results

This feedback reassures the user that the system is actively working and reinforces transparency in how the synthesis is produced.

---

#### Step 5: Reviewing Synthesized Results
After processing completes, the user is shown a structured breakdown of the meeting, including:

- **High-level summary** of the meeting
- **Action items**, with inferred owners and deadlines
- **Decisions** made during the meeting
- **Open questions or blockers** requiring follow-up

Each section is visually separated to reduce cognitive load and allow users to quickly scan for the information most relevant to them.

---

#### Step 6: Editing and Validation by the User
Users can review and edit individual items, correcting details such as ownership, deadlines, or wording.

This step reinforces user agency and positions the AI output as a **draft**, not a final authority.  
Where applicable, users can view the source text from the original notes to understand why an item was extracted.

---

#### Step 7: Taking Next Actions
Once satisfied, the user can choose how to proceed. Options include:

- Exporting synthesized notes in structured formats (JSON, CSV, or Markdown)
- Saving results to a document
- Generating a new synthesis using revised notes

These actions support a variety of workflows without locking users into a single outcome.

---

### Key Experience Principles

The user journey is guided by several core principles:

- **Simplicity**  
  Users are never asked to make complex decisions before seeing value.

- **Transparency**  
  The system communicates what it is doing and why certain outputs were generated.

- **Control**  
  Users can edit, reject, or regenerate results at any point.

- **Trust**  
  Structured outputs are paired with traceability to the original text, increasing confidence in the system’s suggestions.

---

### Success Criteria

The user journey is considered successful if users can move from **raw meeting notes** to a **clear, actionable synthesis** in a single flow, without needing to manually rewrite content or interpret ambiguous summaries.

The experience should feel:
- Efficient
- Predictable
- Supportive of real-world post-meeting tasks
