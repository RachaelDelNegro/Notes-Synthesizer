# Notes-Synthesizer
A small, end-to-end application designed to transform unstructured meeting notes into structured outputs such as action items, decisions, and open questions. Rather than raw summarization, the application emphasizes structured synthesis, converting free-form text into validated, explainable data objects that users can review, edit, and export.
